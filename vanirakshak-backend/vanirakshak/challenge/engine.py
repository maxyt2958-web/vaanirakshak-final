"""Dynamic challenge engine (R3 — active anti-replay defence).

The challenge phrase is generated AFTER the call starts, so a
pre-recorded replay of a genuine voice cannot answer it. The phrase
mixes digits with phonetically diverse Hindi + English words and
ends with an instruction to repeat only the numbers, which:

  * a flustered human can do in 5-15 seconds,
  * a replay of the original phrase cannot (the answer was not known
    when the recording was made),
  * a live TTS can do, but the response latency is usually wrong
    (TTS systems are <300 ms or >1500 ms, humans are 600-1200 ms).

This module ships a deterministic phrase generator and a *stub*
response analyzer (string match + latency check). For the hackathon
demo we use string match against the expected answer; for production
you'd wire this to AI4Bharat IndicConformer or Whisper.
